## Lore

I have grown to love this game since I first received my Starter Kit in June, and have played it with my girlfriend almost every day. However, after some time we got tired of the starter decks and wanted to create our own from scratch. Since it is such a niche game with a small community, there were no websites or even official tools available to assist fans in designing a deck. **Therefore, I knew I had to take this matter into my own hands!**
